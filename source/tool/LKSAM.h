         * @brief Calculates the pedestal value of a data buffer using a sampling method, with an option to subtract it.
         *
         * This method determines the pedestal level of a waveform or data buffer by dividing the buffer into segments,
         * calculating the mean and standard deviation for each segment, and selecting the most stable segments based on a
         * coefficient of variation (CV) threshold. The final pedestal value is an average of selected segments, representing
         * a stable baseline. An option is provided to subtract this pedestal value from the buffer.
         *
         * @param buffer Pointer to an array of doubles representing the data buffer.
         * @param length Integer length of the data buffer.
         * @param sampleLength Integer specifying the length of each segment to be analyzed for pedestal calculation.
         *        Default value is 50.
         * @param cvCut Double threshold for the coefficient of variation, used to filter segments with high variability.
         *        Default value is 0.2.
         * @param subtractPedestal Boolean flag; if true, subtracts the calculated pedestal value from each element in the buffer.
         *        Default value is false.
         *
         * @return The calculated pedestal value as a double.
         *
         * The function works as follows:
         * - Divides the buffer into `sampleLength` segments and calculates the mean and standard deviation for each segment.
         * - Flags segments with a coefficient of variation (CV) below `cvCut` for inclusion in the pedestal calculation.
         * - If two or more segments meet the CV threshold, selects the two most similar segments to estimate a stable pedestal.
         * - Calculates the final pedestal as an average over selected segments, using further filtering to maintain stability.
         * - Optionally subtracts the calculated pedestal value from each element in the original buffer.
         *
         * The pedestal is derived through several checks:
         * - Segments with zero values are flagged and skipped in the comparison.
         * - A reference pedestal mean is set based on the two closest matching segments, and an error threshold is defined.
         * - Segments within the error threshold are aggregated to form the final pedestal estimate.
         *
         * @note If the final pedestal calculation fails, a default value of 4096 is returned.

         * @brief Calculates the continuity index of a histogram based on bin content variations.
         *
         * This method evaluates the continuity index of a histogram by analyzing changes in
         * content values between consecutive bins. It identifies significant fluctuations and
         * zero-value regions in the histogram data to compute an index where a higher value
         * indicates a more continuous, stable histogram.

         * @param thresholdRatio A double representing the ratio for the threshold value, used to
         *        determine significant fluctuations in bin content. The threshold is calculated as
         *        `threshold = max * thresholdRatio`, where `max` is the maximum bin content.
         * @return The continuity index as a double, ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a
         *         highly continuous histogram with minimal significant fluctuations.
         *
         * The method works as follows:
         * - It calculates a threshold based on the maximum bin content and the `thresholdRatio`.
         * - It iterates through the histogram bins, checking for regions with zero values or
         *   significant differences in bin-to-bin content.
         * - For bins with consecutive large changes in content, it increments a counter (`countV`)
         *   and for zero-value regions, it increments another counter (`countX`).
         * - The final continuity index is computed based on the ratio of bins without major
         *   fluctuations or zero regions to the total bins.
         *
         * @note For histograms with fewer than 5 bins, the method returns a default continuity index of 1.
